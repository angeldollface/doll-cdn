# DOLL CDN :dolls: :package:

[![CDN CI](https://github.com/angeldollface/doll-cdn/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/angeldollface/doll-cdn/actions/workflows/main.yml)

***A repository for a CDN for a doll's static assets. :dolls: :package:***

## ABOUT :books:

Since my main `.github.io` repository was getting a bit thicc, I thought I'd move all static assets to a different repository so I can keep the repository for my main website as light as possible. If I want to change the design at some point in the future, this might come in handy. This CDN contains font assets, 3D assets, image assets, and other assets a doll might need.

## FONTS :black_nib:
